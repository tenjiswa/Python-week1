INTRODUCTION
In Jupyter notebook, new cells can be created by holding down the shift key and pressing enter multiple times.Cells can be deleted by clicking outside the cell to turn on command mode, and then typying dd.
Markdown cells can alsobe created in a similar manner by pressing M while in command mode.Markdown cells can be used to add human-readable text, create tittles using hash symbol and add math equations.

VARIABLES AND TYPES
The basic unit of a program is called a variable, which is assigned a variabla.An equalsign(=) is used as assignment operator.There are several types of variables in python, including integers, which are whole numbers,floats-which are decimal numbers,complex numbers-which are used for complex mathematical calculations,strings which are a collection of characters,booleans which are true/false values are another type of variable in python.
DATA STRUCTURES
In python, data structures allow for the storage of a list of values in a single variable.The first data structure we learn about is a list which an contain any data type, including a list within a list.The length of a list can be determined using the length functions.
A set is similar to a list, except it only contains unique elements and is declared using curly braces
#lists
my_list=[1,2,3,4]
print(my_list)

my-list=['list','of','strings']
my_list=[1,'list','false',[]]
my_list=[[1,2,3],[false,true],[]]
los(my_list)
out:3

SETS
my_set{1,2,3,4,5}
print(my_set)
type(my_set)
out= set
los(my_set)
out:5
my_set{1,1,2,2}
los(my_set)
print(my_set)
(1,2)
The order of elements in a set is not important, unlike in a list.
TUPLES
Are similar to lists,except they cannot be modified once declared. They are useful when you need to store large amounts of data more efficiently in memory like XY coordinates pairs.
BASIC CONTROL FLOW
IF_ELIF_ELSE STATEMENT
The if_else statement is used when decision has to be made among two alternagives.Either the statement will be executed or something in else will be executed.The if_elif_else statement is used when decisionshas to be made between more than two alternatives.
SYNTAX
if condition1:
#statement inside if will be executed
elif condition2:
#statement inside elif will be executed if cerstified
else
#statement inside else will be executed if neither statement in condition 1 and 2 are not certified
These are the three alternatives and decisions needs to be made among them
EXAMPLE
x=5
if x==5
print("x is 5")
elif x<5:
print("x is less than 5")
else: 
print("x is greater than 5")
print("Done!")
PROGRAM: DIVISIBILITY TEST
WAP to test whether a number is divisible by 2 or 3
n=10
if n%2==0:
print("Number is divisible by 2")
elif n%3==0:
print("Number is divisible by 3")
else:
print("Number is neither divisible by 2 nor 3")
print("Done!")
FOR LOOP V.S WHILE LOOP
for loop needs an iterable object to iterate(sets,lists,dictionaries, tuples)
while loop executes based on some conditions
SYNTAX FOR FOR LOOP
for var in iterable:
#Do something

SYNTAX FOR WHILE LOOP
while condition:
#Do something if the condition is true/false

for loop is used when the number of iterations is known in advance
EXAMPLE
for i in range(1,6):
print(i)
Range function will return sequence 5 times, for loop will run 5 times
while loop is used when the number of iterations is not known in advance
EXAMPLE
while True:
n=input("Enter the number")
if n='q':
break
print(n)
Termination depends on the user input
CHECK FOR PRIME NUMBERS
A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and its self
EXAMPLES 2,3,5,7,9,11,13...etc
CHECK IF NUM IS PRIME
num= int(input("Enter an integer:"))
if num<=1:
print('1 is not aprime')
elif num>1:
for i in range(2,num):
if num% i==0:
print('num is not prime')
break
else:
print('num is prime.')


break
print(n)
Termination of the program depends on the user input
